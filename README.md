# Async Labs

This repository contains labs from the subject Components of Software Engineering. Part 2. Software Modeling. Software Requirements Analysis.

This repository contains various tasks designed to demonstrate asynchronous programming concepts using Python. Each task focuses on different aspects of concurrency, parallelism, and reactive programming. Below is a description of each lab and links to the relevant files for each task.

## All tasks adaptation for python

  Task 0
  * Prepare GitHub repo for Tasks

  Task 1
  * Choose array fn (map/filter/filterMap/some/find/findIndex) -> chosen ```filter``` fn 
  * Prepare its callback based async counterpart
  * Prepare demo cases for the usage
  * Add new on-demand feature during review e.g.: Add support for debounce (if the task took less then X time to
    complete - add an execution delay)

  Task 2
  * Write use cases for the async-await
  * Add new on-demand feature during review
    e.g.: Add support for parallelism

  Task 3
  * Integrate AbortController or other Cancellable approach

  Task 4 
  * Stream/AsyncIterator/Alternative
  * Ongoing processing of large data sets that do not fit in memory

  Task 5 
  * Observable/EventEmitter/Alternative
  * Reactive message based on communication between entities

Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` file with specific details about the task, the approach taken, and usage instructions.
