# Async Labs

This repository contains labs from the subject Components of Software Engineering. Part 2. Software Modeling. Software Requirements Analysis.
These assignments are for learning asynchronous programming. Each lab has its own folder and task description. 


## Lab Assignments

- [Lab 1](./lab1/README.md)
- [Lab 2](./lab2/README.md)
- [Lab 3](./lab3/README.md)
- [Lab 4](./lab4/README.md)
- [Lab 5](./lab5/README.md)

## All tasks adaptation for python

  Task 0
  * Prepare GitHub repo for Tasks
  * Prepare synchronous adaptation for Task 1

  Task 1
  * Choose array fn (map/filter/filterMap/some/find/findIndex) -> chosen ```filter``` fn 
  * Prepare its callback based async counterpart
  * Prepare demo cases for the usage
  * Add new on-demand feature during review e.g.: Add support for debounce (if the task took less then X time to
    complete - add an execution delay)

  Task 2
  * Write use cases for the async-await
  * Add new on-demand feature during review
    e.g.: Add support for parallelism

  Task 3
  * Integrate AbortController or other Cancellable approach

  Task 4 
  * Stream/AsyncIterator/Alternative
  * Ongoing processing of large data sets that do not fit in memory

  Task 5 
  * Observable/EventEmitter/Alternative
  * Reactive message based on communication between entities
